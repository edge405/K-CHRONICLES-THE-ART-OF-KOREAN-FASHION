###

I recently helped my girlfriend with her **final project** for their web development course, and here's the outcome:  
[**K-CHRONICLES: The Art of Korean Fashion**](https://saylesstial.lovestoblog.com/)

This website is a blog platform designed to celebrate the elegance, creativity, and influence of Korean fashion and culture.

### **Features**

- **User Registration & Login**:  
  Users can create an account or log in to access the full features of the platform.

- **Explore Blogs**:  
  Dive into curated content categorized into three main themes:

  - **K-Culture**: Exploring the essence of Korean culture and how it influences fashion.
  - **Analysis**: In-depth reviews and insights into specific trends, styles, and brands.
  - **Streetwear**: Highlighting the bold and edgy street fashion scene in Korea.

- **Engagement Features**:  
  Users can interact with the content by:
  - **Liking blogs** to show appreciation.
  - **Leaving comments** to share their thoughts and start discussions.

Working on this project involved designing the layout in **Figma** to ensure a seamless and visually appealing user experience. From brainstorming ideas to coding the functionality, it was rewarding to see the concept come to life.

To view the initial design layout of my gf, visit the Figma link below:
