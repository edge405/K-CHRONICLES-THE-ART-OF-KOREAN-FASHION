<h1 style="text-align: center;">K-CHRONICLES: The Art of Korean Fashion</h1>

I recently helped my gf with her midterm project, which involved creating a website blog. To ensure everything lined up visually, I suggested she design the website layout in Figma first. This gave me a clear direction when I started building the actual website.
